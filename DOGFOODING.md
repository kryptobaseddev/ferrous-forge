# Ferrous Forge Dogfooding Guide

This document describes how Ferrous Forge achieves perfect self-compliance (dogfooding) and how to verify it.

## 🏆 Current Status: ZERO VIOLATIONS ACHIEVED!

As of v1.4.0, Ferrous Forge has achieved **ZERO violations** when validating itself - a historic milestone that proves the tool successfully enforces its own standards.

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Current Development Version
```bash
# Build and validate the current codebase
cargo build --release
./target/release/ferrous-forge validate .

# Expected output:
# ✅ All Rust validation checks passed! Code meets Ferrous Forge standards.
```

### Published Crate Version
```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install ferrous-forge@1.4.0

# Validate this repository using the published version
ferrous-forge validate .

# Expected output:
# ✅ All Rust validation checks passed! Code meets Ferrous Forge standards.
```

## 📊 Dogfooding Metrics

### Violation History
| Version | Violations | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| v1.3.0  | 50+ | ❌ Failed | Multiple compliance issues |
| v1.4.0  | **0** | ✅ **Perfect** | **ZERO violations achieved!** |

### Standards Enforced
- ✅ **File Size**: All files under 400 lines
- ✅ **Function Size**: All functions under 70 lines  
- ✅ **Line Length**: All lines under 100 characters
- ✅ **No Unwrap**: Zero `.unwrap()` calls in production code
- ✅ **No Underscore Bandaids**: Zero underscore parameter patterns
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation coverage

## 🚀 Release Process Dogfooding

Our release pipeline includes mandatory dogfooding validation:

```yaml
# From .github/workflows/release.yml
- name: Run dogfooding validation
  run: |
    echo "🔍 Running Ferrous Forge on itself (dogfooding test)..."
    ./target/release/ferrous-forge validate .
    echo "✅ ZERO VIOLATIONS CONFIRMED - Ready for release!"
```

**No release can proceed without ZERO violations.**

## 🧪 Testing Published Version

Use the provided test script to verify the published crate:

```bash
# Run comprehensive test of published version
./scripts/test-published-crate.sh
```

This script:
1. Installs ferrous-forge from crates.io
2. Tests all core functionality
3. Creates projects from templates
4. Validates generated code
5. Verifies the tool works end-to-end

## 🏗️ Development Workflow

### Pre-Commit Validation
```bash
# Always validate before committing
ferrous-forge validate .

# Only commit if output shows:
# ✅ All Rust validation checks passed!
```

### CI/CD Integration
Our GitHub Actions automatically:
1. Builds the project
2. Runs dogfooding validation
3. Blocks any PR/release with violations
4. Publishes only if ZERO violations

### Local Development
```bash
# Quick validation during development
cargo build --release && ./target/release/ferrous-forge validate .

# Template testing
ferrous-forge template list
ferrous-forge template create cli-app test-project --var project_name=test

# Feature testing
ferrous-forge rust check
ferrous-forge edition check
```

## 🎯 Dogfooding Benefits

## 🔄 Continuous Dogfooding

### Daily Development
Every change must maintain ZERO violations:
```bash
# Development cycle
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# ... make changes ...
cargo build --release
./target/release/ferrous-forge validate .  # Must show ZERO violations
git commit -m "feat: new feature"
```

### Release Validation
Every release includes comprehensive dogfooding:
1. **Pre-release**: Local validation
2. **CI Pipeline**: Automated validation  
3. **Release Pipeline**: Final validation before publish
4. **Post-release**: Verification with published version

### Community Verification
Anyone can verify our dogfooding claims:
```bash
# Clone and test
git clone https://github.com/kryptobaseddev/ferrous-forge.git
cd ferrous-forge
cargo install ferrous-forge  # Latest from crates.io
ferrous-forge validate .      # Should show ZERO violations
```

## 📈 Future Goals
