# üöÄ SESSION #23 KICKOFF PROMPT

## MISSION: v1.4.0 RELEASE & FEATURE ROADMAP SETUP

You are starting Session #23 of Ferrous Forge development. **CRITICAL**: Read the `@SESSION_HANDOFF.md` document first to understand the complete project history.

## üéØ PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

### 1. IMMEDIATE: v1.4.0 Release (TODAY)
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Current state is ZERO violations (should be perfect)
- [ ] **UPDATE**: Version 1.3.0 ‚Üí 1.4.0 in Cargo.toml 
- [ ] **GENERATE**: Comprehensive CHANGELOG.md for v1.4.0
- [ ] **UPDATE**: README.md with latest features and ZERO violations achievement
- [ ] **CREATE**: Release notes highlighting the ZERO violations milestone
- [ ] **TAG**: `git tag v1.4.0` and prepare for crates.io publish
- [ ] **TEST**: Final validation that everything works before release

### 2. SETUP: Feature Branch Strategy for v1.5.0+
Based on `docs/FEATURES-PLANS/` documentation:

**Phase 1 (v1.5.0): Enhanced Safety Pipeline**
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/enhanced-safety-pipeline`
- [ ] Implement `ferrous-forge safety install` command
- [ ] Add configurable safety checks via `.ferrous-forge/config.toml`
- [ ] Setup git hooks auto-installation system

**Phase 2 (v1.6.0): Template System 2.0** 
- [ ] Plan community template sharing infrastructure
- [ ] Design template manifests with dependency management
- [ ] Enhance variable substitution system

**Phase 3 (v1.7.0): Advanced Configuration**
- [ ] Design hierarchical config system (system ‚Üí user ‚Üí workspace ‚Üí project)
- [ ] Plan community config registry and sharing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### NEVER BREAK ZERO VIOLATIONS
- You MUST maintain ZERO violations status at all times
- Before ANY code changes, run: `./target/release/ferrous-forge validate .`
- Expected output: "‚úÖ All Rust validation checks passed! Code meets Ferrous Forge standards."
- If violations appear, FIX THEM IMMEDIATELY

### BUILD & TEST VALIDATION
- Build MUST work: `cargo build --release`
- Tests MUST pass: `cargo test` (fix any broken tests first)
- All features MUST be functional (validate with manual testing)

### HONEST PROGRESS TRACKING
- Use TodoWrite tool for task tracking
- Document ALL changes in SESSION_HANDOFF.md
- Commit working code only
- No fake stubs or mock implementations

## üèÜ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Session #23 Success = 10/10 Score IF:**
1. ‚úÖ v1.4.0 is successfully released to crates.io
2. ‚úÖ ZERO violations maintained throughout
3. ‚úÖ Feature branches created with initial implementation
4. ‚úÖ README and documentation updated
5. ‚úÖ All tests passing and builds working
6. ‚úÖ 100% honest progress reporting

## üìö CONTEXT DOCUMENTS

**MUST READ FIRST:**
- `@SESSION_HANDOFF.md` - Complete project history and current state
- `docs/FEATURES-PLANS/FEATURE_SUMMARY.md` - Feature roadmap
- `docs/FEATURES-PLANS/FEATURE_COMPLETION_ASSESSMENT.md` - Current feature status

**KEY LEARNINGS FROM HISTORY:**
- Session #21 left build BROKEN (fixed in #22)
- Session #22 achieved ZERO violations (never go backwards)
- Previous agents often lied about progress - YOU MUST BE 100% TRUTHFUL
- Build must be tested before claiming it works
- Validation must be run to confirm violation count

## üöÄ START HERE

1. **FIRST**: Read `@SESSION_HANDOFF.md` completely
2. **VERIFY**: Run validation to confirm ZERO violations
3. **VALIDATE**: Test build and core functionality  
4. **PLAN**: Use TodoWrite to create implementation plan
5. **EXECUTE**: Start with v1.4.0 release preparation
6. **TRACK**: Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md with ALL progress

Remember: This project has a history of agents making false claims. You must TEST EVERYTHING and be 100% honest about the real state. The user demands complete transparency and working code only.

**ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED**: Ferrous Forge now has ZERO violations and is ready for a major release! Make this session count! üéâ
